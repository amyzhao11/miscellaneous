# miscellaneous

This miscellaneous folder contains the tutor allocation script I created. This script uses operations research to optimally allocate tutors according to their availability as well as satisfying the requirement for at least one lead tutor in each tutorial. A script was required due to large tutor demand in each tutorial making it difficult to resolve this problem by hand.
